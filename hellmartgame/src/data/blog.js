                So, you just downloaded <strong>Hellmart</strong>. You survived Day 1, shoveled the snow, scanned some chips, and the manager told you "Good job." You think to yourself, "This game isn't so hard."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Don't be naive.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most new players hit a brick wall on <strong>Day 3 (The Power Outage)</strong>. But here is the truth: your death on Day 3 usually isn't caused by a lack of skill in that moment. It's caused by <strong>bad decisions you made on Day 1 and Day 2</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the 5 chronic mistakes that wreck beginner saves, and how to fix them.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Mistake #1: The Economy Trap (Spending Too Early)</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Myth:</strong> On Day 1, you earn about $150. You feel rich, so you buy some posters to decorate the shop or stock up on unnecessary snacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Reality:</strong> Day 1 is the <em>only</em> safe day to hoard cash.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Fatal Consequence:</strong> On Day 3, a scripted <strong>Power Outage</strong> will hit your store. If you don't have <strong>$50</strong> in your pocket to buy a <strong>Flashlight</strong> before nightfall, you are dead. Trying to fix the fuse box in total darkness will drain your Sanity or get you killed by the Hollow Customer.
            </p>
            <p class="pro-tip">
                <strong>✅ Fix:</strong> Buy nothing but Coffee (for stamina) on the first two days. Save at least $50 for Day 3.
                <br>
                <em>(Check our <a href="/walkthrough">Day-by-Day Walkthrough</a> for the optimal shopping list.)</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Mistake #2: Judging by Looks (The "Tiny Bob" Error)</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Myth:</strong> On Day 2, a freakishly tall, slender man named "Tiny Bob" appears. He looks terrifying, like a monster. Many players panic and hit the "DENY" button immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Reality:</strong> <strong>Tiny Bob is Human.</strong> He is just... unique looking.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Fatal Consequence:</strong> Denying safe customers destroys your <strong>Reputation (KPI)</strong>. If your reputation drops too low, the Manager will fire you (Game Over).
            </p>
            <p class="pro-tip">
                <strong>✅ Fix:</strong> Never judge an entity by how ugly they are. Judge them by the <strong>CCTV Static</strong>. Tiny Bob's camera feed is crystal clear.
                <br>
                <em>(Confused about who is human? Keep our <a href="/wiki">Entity Identification Database</a> open while you play.)</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Mistake #3: Ignoring the "Typos"</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Myth:</strong> Father Grayson knocks on the door. He speaks calmly, asks for a donation, and looks like a priest. You let him in because he seems polite.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Reality:</strong> Anomalies (Mimics) struggle with human language logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Fatal Consequence:</strong> If you let Father Grayson in, he sacrifices you. Always read the subtitles carefully!
            </p>
            <p class="pro-tip">
                <strong>✅ Fix:</strong> Look for spelling errors. If he spells "Blessing" as <strong>"Blesing"</strong> or "Open" as <strong>"Opn"</strong>, do NOT open the door. Slam that DENY button.
            </p>

            <h2>Mistake #4: Opening the Door Before Fixing the Power</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Myth:</strong> The lights go out on Day 3. Someone rings the doorbell. You think, "I need the money, I'll just check who it is in the dark."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Reality:</strong> You cannot effectively identify Mimics in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Fatal Consequence:</strong> The <strong>Hollow Customer</strong> thrives in darkness. Without lights, you might miss the visual cues (like neck seams or glitches).
            </p>
            <p class="pro-tip">
                <strong>✅ Fix:</strong> When the power dies, your priority list changes: <strong>Flashlight -> Storage Room -> Breaker Box</strong>. Ignore all customers until the lights are back on.
            </p>

            <h2>Mistake #5: Forgetting the Endgame</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Myth:</strong> You focus purely on the daily grind—scanning items and cleaning floors—ignoring the world outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Reality:</strong> If you only work, you are doomed to the <strong>"Groundhog Day" Ending</strong> (Time Loop).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Fatal Consequence:</strong> To escape Hellmart, you need tools. If you reach Day 7 without collecting the hidden <strong>Notes</strong> or buying the <strong>Crowbar</strong>, you cannot trigger the True Ending.
            </p>
            <p class="pro-tip">
                <strong>✅ Fix:</strong> From Day 4 onwards, explore the woods outside your cabin after your shift ends. Start collecting clues early.
                <br>
                <em>(Want to know where the notes are? Read our <a href="/endings">All Endings Guide</a>.)</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Hellmart</strong> is a game of patience and observation. Day 1 is just the calm before the storm. Avoid these 5 traps, save your money, and trust the CCTV, not your eyes.
